- Potential impact
- Any suggested remediation

## Response Expectations

We aim to:
- Acknowledge reports within 3 business days

- Share remediation status and release timing as fixes are prepared

## Disclosure

After a fix is available, we will coordinate disclosure details with the reporter when possible.
